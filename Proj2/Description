A shell is a program which allows a user to send commands to the operating system (OS), and allows the
OS to respond to the user by printing output to the screen. The shell allows a simple character-oriented
interface in which the user types a string of characters (terminated by pressing the Enter(\n)) and the OS
responds by printing lines of characters back to the screen.

A networked client/server application which allows a client program to query a
server program to fetch stock market information. This program will allow a user to examine
stock prices for two major stocks namely Apple(AAPL) and Twitter(TWTR). The user will enter
commands into the client program which runs on one machine. For each command entered by
the user, the client program sends a message containing the query command. The server
program receives the query and responds with a message containing the requested
information.

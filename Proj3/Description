Implement a VM Simulator which will simulate the operation of a virtual memory system.
To launch the system, the simulator will accept one optional command-line argument for the
selection of the page replacement algorithm. The system will then accept commands to read/write
from/to a virtual address space. The system will correctly move pages between disk and
main memory in order to satisfy access requests. The system can properly maintain the
page table as part of this process
